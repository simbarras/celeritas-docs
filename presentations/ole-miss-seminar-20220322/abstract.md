# _Celeritas_: Bringing Exascale computing to HEP detector simulation

Within the next decade experimental High Energy Physics (HEP) will (mostly)
finish building its next generation of particle detectors. This includes
upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider and its main experiments, and completing
the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). This new Era brings a myriad of
challenges, many being on the computational front. As DOE consolidates its
network of Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs) with supercomputers capable of
reaching Exaflops of processing power, it is fundamental to better integrate
these LCFs with HEP computing workflows. In this talk I will provide an overview
of computing in HEP and its many challenges, and present _Celeritas_, a novel
GPU Monte Carlo particle transport code developed by researchers from ORNL,
Fermilab, ANL, and BNL, that aims to close the gap between DOE's LCFs and HEP
experiments.
