# Abstract

The previous Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) report was
responsible for consolidating a set of long term High Energy Physics (HEP)
programs to address scientific questions on all three Department of Energy (DOE)
Cosmic, Energy, and Intensity Frontiers. Two of these efforts are the High
Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and its main experiments, and the Deep
Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The unprecedent scale of these endeavors
is followed by equally challenging computing capacity and storage requirements,
with a commensurate fraction of the total computing cost being driven by Monte
Carlo (MC) detector simulations. To alleviate this bottleneck, we present
_Celeritas_, a new GPU MC detector simulation code designed to take advantage of
the massive processing power of the DOE's Leadership Computing Facilities
(LCFs). With _Celeritas_ we plan to bridge the gap between HEP computing
frameworks and the expanding DOE LCF network, vastly increasing the total
compute capacity available to experiments for MC production campaigns. Here we
present a roadmap for _Celeritas_, including its architecture, physics
capabilities, and strategies for its integration with existing and future
experimental HEP computing workflows.
