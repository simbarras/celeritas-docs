	abstract = {Celeritas is a new computational transport code designed for highperformance simulation of high-energy physics detectors. This work describes some of its current capabilities and the design choices that enable the rapid development of eﬃcient on-device physics. The abstractions that underpin the code design facilitate low-level performance tweaks that require no changes to the higher-level physics code. We evaluate a set of independent changes that together yield an almost 40\% speedup over the original GPU code for a net performance increase of 220× for a single GPU over a single CPU running 8.4M tracks on a small demonstration physics app.},

	abstract = {Within the next decade, experimental High Energy Physics (HEP) will enter a new era of scientiﬁc discovery through a set of targeted programs recommended by the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), including the upcoming High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC) HL-LHC upgrade and the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). These eﬀorts in the Energy and Intensity Frontiers will require an unprecedented amount of computational capacity on many fronts including Monte Carlo (MC) detector simulation. In order to alleviate this impending computational bottleneck, the Celeritas MC particle transport code is designed to leverage the new generation of heterogeneous computer architectures, including the exascale computing power of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs), to model targeted HEP detector problems at the full ﬁdelity of Geant4. This paper presents the planned roadmap for Celeritas, including its proposed code architecture, physics capabilities, and strategies for integrating it with existing and future experimental HEP computing workﬂows.},
