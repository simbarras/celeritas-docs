Many thanks for the detailed paper. It describes very well what you have done in order to achieve a boost in performance on the GPU side. 

I have two questions:
1) do you see any improvements on the CPU side when running the new code wrt the previous version? Does the code autovectorize?
2) you decided to move to custom deep copy and data structures. Before getting to this conclusion, did you explore the possibility to get rid of deeply hierarchical data structures?
