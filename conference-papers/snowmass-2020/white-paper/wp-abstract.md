Within the next decade, experimental HEP will enter a new era of scientific
discovery through a set of targeted programs recommended by the Particle
Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), including the upcoming
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade and the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE). These efforts in the
Energy and Intensity Frontiers will require an unprecedented amount of
computational capacity on
many fronts including Monte Carlo (MC) detector simulation.
In order to alleviate this impending computational
bottleneck, the _Celeritas_ MC particle transport code is designed to leverage
the new generation of heterogeneous computer architectures, including the exascale
computing power of DOE's
Leadership Computing Facilities (LCFs), to model targeted HEP detector
problems at the full fidelity of Geant4.
This paper presents the planned roadmap for _Celeritas_,
including its proposed code architecture, physics capabilities, and strategies
for integrating it with existing and future experimental HEP computing workflows.
