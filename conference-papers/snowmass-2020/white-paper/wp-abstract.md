Within the next decade, experimental HEP will enter a new era of scientific
discovery through a set of targeted programs recommended by the Particle
Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), including the upcoming
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade and the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE). These efforts in the Energy and Intensity Frontiers will
require an unprecedented amount of computational capacity on many
fronts including Monte Carlo (MC) detector simulation. In order to alleviate
this impending computational bottleneck, the Celeritas MC particle transport
code is designed to leverage the new generation of heterogeneous computer
architectures, including the exascale computing power of DOE's Leadership
Computing Facilities (LCFs), to model targeted HEP detector problems at the
full fidelity of Geant4. This paper presents the planned roadmap for Celeritas,
including its proposed code architecture, physics capabilities, and strategies
for integrating it with existing and future experimental HEP computing
workflows.
